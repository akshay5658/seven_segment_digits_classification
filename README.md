# SEVEN-SEGMENT-DIGITS-CLASSIFICATION
### classification of seven segment digits using CNN

### This repo is to learn and implement seven segment digits classifier.
## flow:
#### 1.download the whole folder from git and open the jupyter note book.
#### 2.change the paths of the folder where the images are present, and change the path to read the csv file.
#### 3.Run the code while training the accurscy and the loss can be seen on graph.
